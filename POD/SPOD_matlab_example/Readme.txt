This in an application example for the Speactral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition.

Run the "SPOD_application_example.m" file to compute the SPOD and display the results.
The example data are PIV measurements of turbulent round jet.

The function "SPOD" calculates mode coefficients and spatial mode shapes.
The function "SPODpost" finds pairs of modes that belong together.
